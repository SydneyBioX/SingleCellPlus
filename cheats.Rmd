# `BioC` version 3.10

BioC V 3.10 is the current development branch of the Bioconductor. It should work with R 3.6. 

However, if anyone has trouble with BioC 3.10 package installation, they should be able to get away with that using 3.9. 

The only exception is that `scMerge` must be version 1.1.3 or above. 

# `R 3.5` installation of `scMerge`

https://github.com/SydneyBioX/scMerge/issues/11

```{r R35, eval = FALSE}
## scMerge V0.99.2, compatible with R 3.5.2 and Bioconductor 3.8
devtools::install_github("SydneyBioX/scMerge", ref = "280a7724cd49f10e535f4023a085bc6dc7dc432d") 

## scMerge V0.99.6, the last compatible version with R3.5
devtools::install_github("SydneyBioX/scMerge", ref = "13d4b147b3fab795eb89852188d4708797cbea44")
```
