As discussed in 3rd May 2019, Kevin will work on this part of the workshop. 

Kevin can only work on this if he is instructed by Jean/Kitty/Pengyi what downstream analysis (even if it is DE, I need to know what comparisons) to show. If Yingxin has already worked on this, then some code should be posted here.
